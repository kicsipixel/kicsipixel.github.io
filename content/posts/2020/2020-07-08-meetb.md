My first side-project just released in [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/hu/app/mee-tb/id1519289451?mt=12). This simple macOS app is a Periodic/Mendeleev table. I wrote it in Swift without Storyboard.

During the development I understood how difficult the last 10%. When you solved all (or almost all difficulties) and simple you lost the motivation for fine-tuning or small details.

At the end I'm proud that I'm finished and didn't give up when Apple rejected my first attempt.

In case you are interested you can download and use it for free.

As far as I know this was last macOS/AppKit/Cocoa book by Aaron Hillegass, later he published only about iOS/UIKit. Although the book was written for Xcode 6.3 and Swift 1.2 it is a very interesting and useful reading in case you are interested in macOS programming.
We will create a simple Thermostat app with minimal code using KVC.</description></item><item><title>NSTableView with Cocoa Bindings</title><link>https://kicsipixel.github.io/posts/2020/2020-04-30-bindings/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kicsipixel.github.io/posts/2020/2020-04-30-bindings/</guid><description>I think Cocoa Bindings is a little bit controversial technology. Some people believe less code means less error, easier to debug, according to the others it is hard to read and understand, it&amp;rsquo;s black magic. During the years I tried to understand several times with very little luck. Last night I read a brilliant book by Stuart Grimshaw. I highly recommend his book, he wrote a lot of very useful concept about general programming and Swift coding as well.</description></item></channel></rss>
